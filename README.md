# Finding-time-robust-fuel-efficient-paths-for-a-call-taxi-in-a-stochastic-city-road-network
Published in the Journal of Advanced Transportation

The study aims to find the ideal path for a call taxi moving through an urban road network having real-world obstacles like traffic signals, arc intersections and speed breakers.

These obstacles have an associated cost in terms of travel time and fuel consumption, which is stochastic in nature.

Monte Carlo simulation is used to identify the paths that are ideal for a combination of fuel consumption, average travel time and variability in travel time.
